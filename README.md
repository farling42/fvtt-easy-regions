# Easy Regions

Easy Regions makes it easier to find the correct UUID when managing regions.

It also works for other UUID fields which require a field of a supported type (Macro, Region, RegionBehavior).

## UUID references

- Adds a drop-down menu to all UUIDFields (e.g. for selecting a Macro, Region, or Region Behavior).
