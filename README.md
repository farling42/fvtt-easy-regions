# Easy Regions

Easy Regions makes it easier to find the correct UUID when managing regions.

It also works for other UUID fields which require a field of a supported type (Macro, Region, RegionBehavior).

## UUID references

- Adds a drop-down menu to all UUIDFields (e.g. for selecting a Macro, Region, or Region Behavior).

You can enter some of the text of the label (not the UUID) in order for the drop-down list to automatically shrink to just the entries containing the entered text.

## Region Icons

- Define an Icon and specify its colour and size, to be displayed in the centre of each polygon of a region.

## Module Options

There is a module option to restrict the list of UUIDs for Scenes, Regions and Region Behaviors to only those in Scenes which have Navigation enabled (and therefore appear in the list across the top of the canvas). _This should help alleviate the list being too long in worlds with many scenes._

## Installation

Until it is approved, use the following manual manifest link to install the module:
